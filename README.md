IDLE Version (Original)
-----------------------

Kaysee syntax is also available for IDLE. This is the "original" version of this
syntax theme that the Atom theme is based on.

You can download it from Google Drive: [Kaysee syntax for IDLE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B01hVcJFK8KEUzRIUW9KRi02QVU/view?usp=sharing)  
This file also contains some other dark syntax themes for IDLE.
